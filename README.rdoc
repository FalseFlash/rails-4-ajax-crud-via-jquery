This is an example app of how to do ajax crud in rails 4 via jQuery
Things you may want to cover. We're not using unobtrusive JavaScript or templates.

The root of the application is sent to the static controller's index action. So look in static/index.html.erb to see the html.

The "internal API" part of this app is located in the controllers/football_players_controller.rb file.

The ajax happens in the javascripts/crud.js file.
